Ecopix was built from the ground up, prioritising flexibility, extensibility and speed! The theme gives you super powers to easily change the appearance and functionality of your website, without learning how to code!


**Appearance -> Customiser is the place where you will be able to find most of your Ecopix settings.**
We took the default WordPress Customiser experience to the next level by enabling live previews for the changes you make. This means, the preview will reflect the changes you make in real time, no need to refresh!

The Customiser has been neatly organised, in order to give you peace of mind that you will not get lost when browsing around the options. For example, if you are working on your Header, you will find everything available at your fingertips, without needing to navigate to another section.
